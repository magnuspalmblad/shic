# shic
shic is a collection of shims for use in automated workflow composition

Shims are here understood as being small pieces of glue code to gently massage, or shim, the data produced by one software to the data expected by another. Semantically they are format converters, although its input and output could be different dialects or interpretations of the same format.

The shims are contained in the [shims](shims) folder.

The [shims.md]{shims.md) table contains minimum metadata for all shims, including [EDAM](https://edamontology.org/) data type and format for the shim input and output (the operation typically being [Conversion](https://edamontology.org/)), the [domain](http://edamontology.org/topic_0003) and intended use.

shic is developed as part of the [Workflomics](https://workflomics.org](https://research-software-directory.org/software/workflomics) project.
