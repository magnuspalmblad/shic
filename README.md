# shic
shic is a collection of shims for use in automated workflow composition

_What is a "shim"?_

In our interpretation (not to be confused with the one in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)), a shim is a short code fragment that fills the gaps when creating a data processing workflow from separate software tools. Here a shim then can be a few lines of code that extract the necessary information from a more complex file, converts between similar but not identical file types, or adds redundant information to fill input requirements.

In this repository, we collect as simple script files (bash, Python or others).

For a rough but standardized description of the functionality, we rely on the [EDAM ontology](edamontology.github.io/).
